# accessible-map-finder

I want to create an app that displays current location map and pinpoints accessible locations in the map from source to destination and finds the shortest route between the two as well. the app also has features to filter out the type of place such as hospital or park etc and and displays nearby accessible locations. another feature of the app is that the property owners can register that their property is accessible . also the users can also register their disabilities such that locations are shown accordingly
